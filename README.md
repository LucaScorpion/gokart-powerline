## Installation üöÄ

First download the archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/LucaScorpion/gokart-prompt/releases/latest).
Next, follow the steps for your terminal setup:

<details>
<summary>Oh My Zsh</summary>

Extract the archive to `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes`:

```shell
tar xzvf gokart-prompt-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes"
```

Make sure to replace `gokart-prompt-linux-amd64.tar.gz` with the filename of the archive you downloaded.

Next, symlink `gokart.zsh-theme` in your `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes` directory:

```shell
ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/gokart-prompt/gokart.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/gokart.zsh-theme"
```

Finally, set `ZSH_THEME="gokart"` in your `.zshrc`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bash</summary>

Extract the archive, for example to your `$HOME` directory:

```shell
tar xzvf gokart-prompt-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C "$HOME"
```

Make sure to replace `gokart-prompt-linux-amd64.tar.gz` with the filename of the archive you downloaded.

Finally, source `gokart.bash-theme` in your `.bashrc`:

```shell
source "$HOME/gokart-prompt/gokart.bash-theme"
```
</details>

## Requirements ‚úÖ

### [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)

```

This should print a "branch" icon.
